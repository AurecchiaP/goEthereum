# GoEthereum

## How to try it out locally?

First install Node, for example with brew:

`$ brew install node`

Then install truffle using npm:

`$ npm install -g truffle`

Once this is done, clone or download the repo, and from the root of the folder install the dependencies with:

`npm install`

Finally we can start the local development environment with:
`$ truffle develop`

`> migrate`

And again from the root folder run the application:

`$ npm run dev`

Once the application is running, you can use the Chrome extension MetaMask to connect to the private BlockChain ("localhost:9495" if using standard truffle develop) and try out Go Ethereum.
